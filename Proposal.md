## Description  
The idea of the project is to allow users to lease their idle computing resource (from portable laptops to powerful workstations) to customers who are in need for various tasks like deep learning, video rendering, gaming, etc. Unlike popular Iaas cloud computing providers, this website aims to provide p2p service through the traditional form of a shopping website, which will not only provide customers with various choices of machines, but also greatly reduce the cost from a centualized computing server.
